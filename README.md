# Portfolio site project

This project is part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program launched by Udacity and Google. It uses HTML5 and CSS3 knowledges.

As soon as other projects will be completed, the site will be as well with the related codes.

Other improvements are coming soon too, like Navbar and pages to "Profile", "Portfolio" and "Contact", as well as images with own vector graphic design.

Stay tuned! :wink:
